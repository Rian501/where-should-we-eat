# HANGRR

This is a front-end capstone project for Nashville Software School, to demonstrate understanding of the basic principles of front-end technologies and skills after 3 months of training.
Since I frequently suffer from indecision coupled with too many choices at hungry times, I decided to make an app that would give me suggestions at random which I could reject one by one until I reached something I would like.
Built with AngularJS and styled with Bootstrap 4, Hangrr geolocates the user with HTML5, then leverages the Google Places API to find and suggest nearby, currently-open restaurants at random. If the user is logged in, the app filters out a Firebase-saved list of user blacklisted items and pushes user's "try-later" saved locations to the top of the suggestion array.
The app is deployed here: https://whereshouldweeat-369b9.firebaseapp.com

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this code on your own machine, you will need to create a Firebase account and save your own authentication specs. Mine are not pushed up.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
